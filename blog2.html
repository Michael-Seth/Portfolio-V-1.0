          <h3>How to start a tech blog in 2022</h3>
        </header>
        <div class="article-content">
          <p>
            Do you want to create something meaningful? Use your technical
            expertise for knowledge-share? Then why not start a tech blog for
            beginners. Right now, you are probably clueless, confused, and
            confounded with choices.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have no idea how to start a blog or how to be a blogger. This
            guide will give you an overview of starting a tech blog along with
            amazing tips on how to grow your tech blog!
          </p>

          <h4 id="">1. Find a niche for yourself</h4>

          <p>
            So you are a geek and hands-on with probably Java or Azure or a jack
            of all trades. You can be an IT whiz, but remember technology is
            ever-changing. It seems there’s always a new piece of tech to
            replace something obsolete. Your first task is to find your niche or
            a specific topic area that you may be interested in. “Tech” is too
            broad a niche so you should focus on something that has less
            competition, but still enough to have a good audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, a PC gamer can look at and review PC hardware. Someone
            who has smartphone knowledge can focus on iPhone or Android tech or
            a tech blog for beginners.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, it would help if you were wary of what others are interested
            in. If you don’t do your research right, you might find yourself
            with a blog that doesn’t draw in a lot of people. You can think a
            blog on dog gadgets is great because you are a techie and a dog
            lover — but is that going to draw in many people? But a blog on
            tools that helps take care of and train dogs appeals to a much
            bigger audience of readers.
          </p>

              alt="Michael osas blog-1"
            />
          </div>

          <h4 id="">2. Work on a Unique Name for the Blog</h4>
          <p>
            This is fun — creating your blog name. You have the option to for a
            short, sweet name and is relevant to your audience. It can be
            something like Tech Today, Tech Made Simple, etc. Finalize the names
            time to get your website set up. You can either do it on your own
            through options like WordPress/BlueHost or hire a professional.
          </p>

          <h6>There are Some Simple Steps to Acing the Name of your Blog:</h6>
          <p>
            Keep it short and sweet – you don’t want to force potential visitors
            to have to type a bunch of words to visit your website. Ideally, no
            more than 14 characters are suggested.
          </p>
          <p>
            It would help if you chose a .com, .org, or .net because they are
            the easiest for people to remember.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, don’t use something that is not pronounced easily. Go for
            something that people can spell and pronounce.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try to avoid numbers and hyphens as it makes the URL seem clunky and
            it’s also difficult to type out when you add hyphens.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use your name if possible because that makes it the perfect choice
            for a personal blog. I’ll speak more about this later.
          </p>
          <div class="wp-block-image">
            <img src="img/blog-2.jpg" alt="Michael osas blog-1" />
          </div>
          <h4 id="p0a2nol354d">3. Sort the Essentials.</h4>
          <p>
            In the case of tech blogs, especially ones where you review tech, it
            is critical to have access to technology. For example, if you are
            talking abt tech repair, you have to showcase the parts like a
            camera or a video recorder. As mentioned earlier, since technology
            is always changing, a tech blog can be a little more expensive than
            others, provided you’re doing more than just posting tech news. And
            last but not least when it comes to starting a tech blog, do make
            sure that you have social media accounts in place too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sign up for BlueHost: This is a web hosting provider that offers
            server space to host your website. Keep in mind that every single
            website needs a web host. There are different plans to choose from.
          </p>
          <p>
            Install WordPress: This is a content management system (CMS) that
            lets you create and manage blog posts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Have an eye-catching theme: eye-catching WordPress theme. WordPress
            is straightforward to change the way your website looks. Use
            “themes” that can be swapped in and out. As you change the theme,
            your site will also change, but your blog content stays the same.
          </p>

          <h4 id="">4. Install Plugins for WordPress</h4>
          <p>
            WordPress is infinitely customizable because it is open-source so
            you can do whatever you want. And if you want changes, doing them
            with plugins is the easiest way to go. These are batches of software
            you can install within WordPress. They give you extra functionality
            and add many additional features to your site without having to code
            anything yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tip: Use them in a limited way because they can cause unexpected
            conflicts with each other; they become a security liability since
            it’s unlikely that every plugin owner will maintain the plugin over
            time.
          </p>

          <div class="wp-block-image">
            <img src="img/blog-1.jpg" alt="Michael osas blog-1" />
          </div>
          <h4 id="">5. Set-up Google Analytics.</h4>

          <p>
            As a techie, you are probably aware that it is essential to install
            Google Analytics, a free website analytics tool from Google. Using
            this tool, you can keep a tab of the number of people are visiting
            your website, sort them demographically, check what blog posts and
            pages are receiving the most visits and don’t get into the
            complications — keep it simple!
          </p>

          <h4>6. Plan and Work your Email List</h4>
          <p>
            Email lists are the best marketing tool you can opt for promoting
            your blog. These email lists are like a giant laser ray you can
            focus on. Be it for promotion, publishing, pitching, etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, if you had a podcast just interviewed, you should pitch
            the same to your audience. Across the past many years, many
            marketing channels have come and gone, but nothing compares to the
            power of a high-quality email list. It is possible that you are not
            sure of what to send your email subscribers, that’s okay. The idea
            is that you should start gathering a list of subscribers and build
            the foundation early.
          </p>

          <h4>7. Building your Audience & Growing your Blog.</h4>
          <p>
            With your tech blog, you have the option to build your audience of
            1,000 true fans slowly and consistently. Along with what was
            mentioned in the earlier point, do ensure quality. Use Google,
            research the topic, see what other people have done, and then ask
            yourself how you can write something even better.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can take the topics written earlier and just find a new take or
            perspective on them. Alongside, do keep looking for topics that
            haven’t already been covered. Try to be authentic so people can get
            to know you, and this is critical so that your audience connects
            with you faster.
          </p>

          <p>
            Try to make the blog interactive. You can have the option of leaving
            feedback, have an option for comments, etc. You should also post in
            Facebook groups, subreddits, on Twitter. Do podcast interviews, get
            speaking engagements, and try to engage with communities to grow
            your tech blog.
          </p>

          <h4 id="ylq1de2x9ie">Now you know</h4>

          <i>
            Let the creativity flow in your tech blog. It could be interviews,
            stories, quizzes, or simply giving information. There’s a wealth of
            information out there, and you need to use it. Understand your
            audience well and keep tweaking your blogs to meet their
            requirements too. This would generate traffic and help monetize your
            blog.
