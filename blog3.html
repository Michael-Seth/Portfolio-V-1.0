            Why Do I Need a Website?<br />
            5 Reasons Why Having a Website is a Must
          </h3>
        </header>
        <div class="article-content">
          <p>
            When it seems that social media rule the Internet, you might ask
            yourself, “Do I need a website?” The answer is yes, and I’m here to
            tell you why.
          </p>

          <!--more-->

          <p>
            In 2019, 70-80% of people were researching companies online before
            visiting it/making a purchase, and the same percentage of customers
            could be lost to small businesses without a website. And when the
            world suddenly required more online presence than real-life presence
            the following year, having your own website became even more
            crucial.
          </p>

          <p>Here are five ultimate reasons why you need a website in 2021.</p>

          <h4 id="5g9dal9x5gs">
            1. Having a website makes you look professional and increases trust.
          </h4>

          <p>
            Most people don’t trust a business without a good website. A clean,
            modern page that is regularly updated and pops up in search engines
            is an <em>instant</em> credibility boost. Potential customers will
            trust you more and have all the information they need in one place.
            In a digital age, we expect businesses to have a web presence. Even
            the smallest local business needs a website.
          </p>

          <p>
            Anyone can easily create a Facebook page or an Instagram account
            with fake data, your name/handle, and the profiles may look
            identical to yours. So, a professional business website legitimizes
            your company in ways no other social media channels would.
          </p>

          <p>
            And if you don’t have a business and you’re considering creating a
            place for your portfolio, to show off your work, or something that
            represents yourself to send to recruiters when looking for a job –
            there’s not a more professional way to stand out from the crowd than
            having a personal website.
          </p>

          <div class="wp-block-image">
            <img
              src="img/glenn-carstens-peters-npxXWgQ33ZQ-unsplash.jpg"
              alt="Michael osas blog-1"
            />
          </div>

          <h4 id="fvqxjuuwbwj">
            2. A business website will bring you more customers and increase
            conversions.
          </h4>

          <p>
            Well-optimized websites can pop up on the first page of Google
            search attracting new customers that weren’t looking specifically
            for you but were just researching a topic. There’s a much bigger
            chance of someone ‘stumbling upon’ your website than a social media
            profile. Also, comparing you and any competing business or offer is
            easier when all the parties involved have a pro website.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you invest in Google Ads or Facebook Ads, you can direct the
            traffic straightway to your website. On the page, your leads will
            have all the details to make an informed purchase, and a
            call-to-action to motivate them. Pages with built-in popup forms and
            web push notifications encourage website visitors to stay in touch
            and come back.
          </p>
          <p>
            A website is available 24/7, every day of the year, from anywhere
            around the globe – that makes your business stay on customer’s minds
            even after business hours. Websites broaden your reach, and promote
            you without a break.
          </p>
          <div class="wp-block-image">
            <img src="img/blog-img-2.jpg" alt="Michael osas blog-1" />
          </div>
          <h4 id="p0a2nol354d">
            3. Creating your own website is much easier and less expensive than
            you expect.
          </h4>

          <p>
            If you believe that to create a stunning website, you need to be a
            tech-savvy expert of web design, or have a team of engineers and a
            professional web designer on speed dial – I’m happy to say – you’re
            wrong!
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two sides to this reason. The first is your freedom of
            expression on a website. You can’t customize your social media
            presence to the same extent. All your assets have to be the same
            format as everybody else’s. If you really want to stand out, a
            website is the answer.
          </p>

          <h4 id="d2waek35lic">
            4. A website gives you full control over the medium.
          </h4>

          <p>
            The absolute design freedom gives you an opportunity to present your
            brand in a unique way and showcase its voice and personality.
          </p>

          <p>
            The control over your image on a webpage isn’t only about the
            graphics and layout. You decide what to put out there, so if you
            have any cool online reviews, customer testimonials, videos, etc.,
            they can all share the space on your site.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have a gallery or a portfolio, this is also a chance to
            display it in a creative way. You can redesign and change anything
            on a website any time you want.
          </p>

          <p>
            The other side of ‘full control’ is that a webpage is your owned
            media. You don’t have to follow the ever-changing rules of social
            platforms, and while the platforms themselves come and go (<em
              >remember MySpace?</em
            >) your website can stay in business forever. Also, any Internet
            user can engage with your website without creating an account.
          </p>
          <div class="wp-block-image">
            <img src="img/blog-img.jpg" alt="Michael osas blog-1" />
          </div>
          <h4 id="7cn77olwj1s">
            5. Websites are the center of all marketing efforts.
          </h4>

          <p>
            A website can be the first place where potential customers interact
            with you and learn about your business.
          </p>

          <p>
            It can also be where they land on last, to make a purchase, because
            they were redirected from an email, a Facebook ad or an Instagram
            post.
          </p>

          <p>
            Maybe they want to <em>receive</em> your emails, and that’s why they
            visit your site – to sign up.
          </p>

          <p>
            Someone driving by your facilities clicks the pin on Google Maps,
            which directs them to your website with pricing or menu.
          </p>

          <p>
            They might have typed your URL into their browser from a physical
            business card. Or, after watching your YouTube video they ‘clicked
            the link in the description below’ to get a coupon code for your new
            online course.
          </p>

          <p>
            All your marketing efforts, no matter if your business is operating
            online or offline, should sprout from and lead to your own, stunning
            and informative webpage.
          </p>

          <p>
            Campaigns are also easier to manage when everything is
            interconnected and the common denominator is a website. So, having a
            website is a priority and the first step to success.
          </p>

            I hope these five simple reasons cleared your doubts about creating
            a professional website for your business. If you don’t have even a
            basic website you’re missing out on a massive opportunity to
            increase your good online reputation. The sooner you create one, the
            more customers will trust your brand. This is a simple and
            inexpensive way to increase your revenue, boost your company’s
            credibility and establish your place in the industry.
